This is a modified version of the University of Manchester Course [R for data analysis](https://app.manchester.ac.uk/rrdata), tailored for the digital humanities.

The UoM R course is, itself an abridged and modified version of the Software Carpentry lesson [R for reproducible scientific analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder).


**[The slide deck used in this course can be found here]({{ page.root }}/slides/).**


The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to use R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party packages greatly extend its usefulness.  The emphasis of these materials is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach good practices for research computing.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the
programming language R for data analysis.  The statistical content is minimal, though learners should know _how_ to find the appropriate functions and packages for a statistical analysis by the end of the course.

The course focuses on using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) for data analysis, rather than base R.
