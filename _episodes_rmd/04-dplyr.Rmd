In the previous episode we used the `readr` package to load tabular data into a tibble within R.  The `readr` package is part of a family of packages known as the   [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/).  The tidyverse packages are designed to work well together; they provide a modern and streamlined approach to data-analysis, and deal with some of the idiosyncrasies of base R.


This loads the most commonly used packages in the tidyverse; we used `readr` in the previous episode.  We will cover all of the other main packages, with the exception of `purrr` in this course. There are other [libraries included](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) but these are less widely used, and must be loaded manually if they are required; these aren't covered in this course. 

Let's dive in and look at how we can use the tidyverse to analyse and, in a couple of episodes' time,  plot data from the [gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/).  At [the start of the course]({{ page.root}}/02-project-intro), you should have copied the file `gapminder-FiveYearData.csv` to your `data` directory.     Take a look at it using a text editor such as notepad.   The first line contains variable names, and values are separated by commas.  Each record starts on a new line. 

As we did with the [previous episode]({{ page.root }}/03-loading-data-into-R) we use the `read_csv()` function to load data from a comma separated file. Let's make a new script (using the file menu), and load the tidyverse: (in the previous episode we only loaded `readr`; since we'll be using several packages in the tidyverse, we load them all)

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
gapminder <- read_csv("./data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

As we discussed in the [previous episode]({{ page.root }}/03-loading-data-into-R), variables in R can be character, integer, double, etc.   A tibble (and R's built in equivalent; the data-frame) require that all the values in a particular column have the same data type.  The `read_csv()` function will attempt to infer the data type of each column, and prints the column types it has guessed to the screen.  If the wrong column types have been generated, you can pass the `col_types=` option to `read_csv()`.  

For example, if we wanted to load the `pop` column as a character string, we would use:

```{r}
gapminderPopChar <- read_csv("./data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", 
                             col_types = cols(
                               country = col_character(),
                               year = col_integer(),
                               pop = col_character(),
                               continent = col_character(),
                               lifeExp = col_double(),
                               gdpPercap = col_double()
) )
```

> ## Setting column types
> 
> Try reading a file using the `read_csv()` defaults (i.e. guessing column types).
> If this fails you can cut and paste the guessed column specification, and modify
> this with the correct column types.  It is good practice to do this anyway; it makes

## Manipulating tibbles 

Manipulation of tibbles means many things to many researchers. We often
select only certain observations (rows) or variables (columns). We often group the
data by a certain variable(s), or calculate summary statistics.

## The `dplyr` package

The  [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf)
package is part of the tidyverse.  It provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating tibbles (and their base-R cousin, the `data.frame`) 
in a way that will reduce repetition, reduce the probability of making
errors, and probably even save you some typing. 

We will cover:

1. selecting variables with `select()`
2. subsetting observations with `filter()`
3. grouping observations with `group_by()`
4. generating summary statistics using `summarize()`
5. generating new variables using `mutate()`
6. Sorting tibbles using `arrange()`
7. chaining operations together using pipes `%>%` 

## Using `select()`

If, for example, we wanted to move forward with only a few of the variables in
our tibble we use the `select()` function. This will keep only the
variables you select.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder,year,country,gdpPercap)
print(year_country_gdp)
```

Select will select _columns_ of data.  What if we want to select rows that meet certain criteria?  

## Using `filter()`

The `filter()` function is used to select rows of data.  For example, to select only countries in 
Europe:

```{r}
gapminder_Europe <- filter(gapminder, continent=="Europe") 
print(gapminder_Europe)
```

Only rows of the data where the condition (i.e. `continent=="Europe"`) is `TRUE` are kept.

## Using pipes and dplyr

We've now seen how to choose certain columns of data (using `select()`) and certain rows of data (using `filter()`).  In an analysis we often want to do both of these things (and many other things, like calculating summary statistics, which we'll come to shortly).    How do we combine these?

There are several ways of doing this; the method we will learn about today is using _pipes_.  

The pipe operator `%>%` lets us pipe the output of one command into the next.   This allows us to build up a data-processing pipeline.  This approach has several advantages:

* We can build the pipeline piecemeal - building the pipeline step-by-step is easier than trying to 
perform a complex series of operations in one go
* It is easy to modify and reuse the pipeline
* We don't have to make temporary tibbles as the analysis progresses

> ## Pipelines and the shell
>
> If you're familiar with the Unix shell, you may already have used pipes to
> pass the output from one command to the next.  The concept is the same, except
> the shell uses the `|` character rather than R's pipe operator `%>%`

Let's rewrite the select command example using the pipe operator:

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year,country,gdpPercap)
print(year_country_gdp)
```

To help you understand why we wrote that in that way, let's walk through it step
by step. First we summon the gapminder tibble and pass it on, using the pipe
symbol `%>%`, to the next step, which is the `select()` function. In this case
we don't specify which data object we use in the `select()` function since in
gets that from the previous pipe. 

What if we wanted to combine this with the filter example? I.e. we want to select year, country and GDP per capita, but only for countries in Europe?  We can join these two operations using a pipe; feeding the output of one command directly into the next:


```{r}
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>%
    filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
    select(year,country,gdpPercap)
print(year_country_gdp_euro)
```

Note that the order of these operations matters; if we reversed the order of the `select()` and `filter()` functions, the `continent` variable wouldn't exist in the data-set when we came to apply the filter.  

What about if we wanted to match more than one item?  To do this we use the `%in%` operator:

```{r}
gapminder_scandinavia <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Denmark",
                        "Norway",
                        "Sweden"))
```

> ```{r, eval=FALSE}

## Sorting tibbles

The `arrange()` function will sort a tibble by one or more of the variables in it:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(pop)
```
We can use the `desc()` function to sort a variable in reverse order:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop))
```

## Generating new variables

The `mutate()` function lets us add new variables to our tibble.  It will often be the case that these are variables we _derive_ from existing variables in the data-frame. 

As an example, the gapminder data contains the population of each country, and its GDP per capita.  We can use this to calculate the total GDP of each country:

```{r}
gapminder_totalgdp <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop)

```

We can also use functions within mutate to generate new variables.  For example, to take the log of `gdpPercap` we could use:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(logGdpPercap = log(gdpPercap))
```

The dplyr cheat sheet contains many useful functions which can be used with dplyr.  This can be found in the help menu of RStudio. You will use one of these functions in the next challenge.

> 
> Create a tibble containing each country in Europe, its life expectancy in 2007
> and the rank of the country's life expectancy. (note that ranking the countries _will not_ sort the table; the row order will be unchanged.  You can use the `arrange()` function to sort the table).

## Calculating summary statistics

We often wish to calculate a summary statistic (the mean, standard deviation, etc.)
for a variable.  We frequently want to calculate a separate summary statistic for several
groups of data (e.g. the experiment and control group).    We can calculate a summary statistic
for the whole data-set using the dplyr's `summarise()` function:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarise(meanlife = mean(lifeExp))
```

To generate summary statistics for each value of another variable we use the 
`group_by()` function:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(meanlife = mean(lifeExp))
```


## Aside

In the examples above it would be preferable to calculate the weighted mean (to reflect the different populations of the countries).
R can calculate this for us using `weighted.mean(lifeExp, pop)`. For simplicty I've used the regular mean in the above examples.

## `count()` and `n()`
A very common operation is to count the number of observations for each
group. The `dplyr` package comes with two related functions that help with this.


If we need to use the number of observations in calculations, the `n()` function
is useful. For instance, if we wanted to get the standard error of the life
expectancy per continent:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2002) %>%	
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(se_pop = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
```

Although we could use the `group_by()`, `n()` and `summarize()` functions to calculate the number of observations in each group, `dplyr` provides the `count()` function which automatically groups the data, calculates the totals and then ungroups it. 

For instance, if we wanted to check the number of countries included in the
dataset for the year 2002, we can use:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2002) %>%
    count(continent, sort = TRUE)
```
We can optionally sort the results in descending order by adding `sort=TRUE`:



## Connect mutate with logical filtering: `ifelse()`

When creating new variables, we can hook this with a logical condition. A simple combination of 
`mutate()` and `ifelse()` facilitates filtering right where it is needed: in the moment of creating something new.
This easy-to-read statement is a fast and powerful way of discarding certain data (even though the overall dimension
of the tibble will not change) or for updating values depending on this given condition.

The `ifelse()` function takes three parameters.  The first it the logical test.  The second is the value to use if the test is TRUE for that observation, and the third is the value to use if the test is FALSE.

```{r}
## keeping all data but "filtering" after a certain condition
# calculate GDP only for people with a life expectation above 50
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear_above25 <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = ifelse(lifeExp > 50, gdpPercap * pop / 10^9, NA)) 

```
